Comet automatically identifies comments based on file type, using the correct delimiter:

| Go       | `.go`     | `//`             |
| Python   | `.py`     | `#`              |
| C        | `.c`      | `//`, `/*...*/`  |

3. **Build the CLI**

    ```bash
    go build

## ðŸ›  Usage

### Basic Usage

Run Comet to scan for comments in the current directory:

```bash
./comet
```

### Scan a Specific Directory

Provide a project path to scan for comments in that specific folder:

```bash
./comet /path/to/your/project
```

### Generated Documentation

After scanning, Comet will generate a `comments.txt` file in the project root with a structured list of comments:

```bash
/path/to/your/file.go
Line 3: // This is a comment
Line 15: // Another comment

/path/to/your/file.py
Line 8: # Python comment example
```

### Comment Removal

When prompted, you can remove all detected comments by typing "y" (or keep them by typing "n"). This removes comments directly from the files scanned.

## ðŸ¤– Example Output

```bash
Starting comment scan in directory: /path/to/your/project
Comment found at /path/to/your/file.go:3 - // Initial setup
Comment found at /path/to/your/file.go:15 - // Deprecated function

Would you like to remove the comments? (y/n): y
Comments removed and saved to comments.txt
```
